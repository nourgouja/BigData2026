    "title": "Israel Palestine War | What is Happening? |  Explained by Dhruv Rathee",
    "description": "On October 7th, a significant escalation occurred between Israel and Palestine. Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel, leading to casualties on both sides. Israel retaliated with 'Operation Iron Swords', targeting Hamas assets in Gaza. The international community, including India, the US, the EU, and others, have expressed their concerns and stands on the issue. A major point of discussion is the failure of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to predict such an attack. While the Palestinian cause has historical roots and deserves attention, the use of terrorism is condemned. It's essential to remember our shared humanity and hope for a peaceful resolution, envisioning a united Israel-Palestine with liberty and equality for all.

    "description": "British journalist Mona Chalabi corrected the framing of the Israel-Gaza war to the Israel-Palestine war when she received a Pulitzer Prize at Columbia University. In solidarity with the students of New York University facing suspension and arrest for supporting Palestine, she posted a video recorded in October 2023.\nIn her brief speech, Chalabi emphasised the reluctance of many attending the ceremony to address the Palestine issue. She noted that although she wasn't scheduled to give a speech, she found it necessary due to factual inaccuracies.\nThe British data journalist, illustrator, and writer of Iraqi descent received the prize for Illustrated Reporting and Commentary from Columbia University President Emeritus Lee Bollinger last October.\nOn 19 April 2024, she mentioned that she had emailed the President of Columbia in March but had not received a response.\nIn sharing the video, Chalabi extended her support to student protesters at Columbia University in New York, who organised the Gaza Solidarity Encampment. Over 100 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested following its organisation. Several students at Columbia University have also been suspended from the university and its affiliated institutions.\nIt's noteworthy that Chalabi won the Prize for her striking illustrations, which blend statistical reporting with insightful analysis. These illustrations provide readers with a deeper understanding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's vast wealth and economic influence.\nSubscribe to our channel: http://ow.ly/AVlW30n1OWH\n\nSubscribe to MEE Telegram channel to stay up to date: https://t.me/MiddleEastEye_TG\n\nMiddle East Eye Website: https://middleeasteye.net\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@middleeasteye\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/MiddleEastEye\nLike us on Facebook: https://facebook.com/MiddleEastEye\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MiddleEastEye",

    "description": "Why Palestinians in Gaza have suffered for decades.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOn October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping over 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes have killed, as of this video, over 6,400 Palestinians in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. \n\nSince 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.\n\nToday, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call \u201ccollective punishment\u201d as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.\n\nThis latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what\u2019s behind Israel\u2019s occupation and its blockade of Gaza. \n\nSources and readings: \n\nThank you for watching! We know we couldn\u2019t cover everything about the Gaza Strip, this was just a start. Below are a couple of sources and readings you might find helpful to learn more. \n\nGisha, an Israeli nonprofit that works to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians, has done so much research on the closure of Gaza and how it impacts Palestinians there.

    "title": "Israel Palestine War | What is Happening? |  Explained by Dhruv Rathee",
    "description": "On October 7th, a significant escalation occurred between Israel and Palestine. Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel, leading to casualties on both sides. Israel retaliated with 'Operation Iron Swords', targeting Hamas assets in Gaza. The international community, including India, the US, the EU, and others, have expressed their concerns and stands on the issue. A major point of discussion is the failure of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to predict such an attack. While the Palestinian cause has historical roots and deserves attention, the use of terrorism is condemned. It's essential to remember our shared humanity and hope for a peaceful resolution, envisioning a united Israel-Palestine with liberty and equality for all.

    "description": "Palestinians in the Gaza strip held mass funerals for two members of Hamas' political office, Jawad Abu Shammala and Zakaria Abu Maamar, killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Tuesday, October 10. The Israeli military said they had been struck overnight. \u2060\n\u2060\nThey were the first senior Hamas members killed since Israel began pounding the enclave. Israel said Abu Shammala had led a number of operations targeting Israeli civilians. He was a member of the Hamas politburo in charge of economic affairs. \u2060\n\u2060\nThree Gaza journalists were also killed while reporting outside a building in Gaza, bringing the number of journalists killed so far to six. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry said Israeli strikes had since Saturday destroyed more than 22,600 residential units and 10 health facilities and damaged 48 schools. \u2060#Gaza #Israel #reels #videography #voanews #news #palestine \n\n\u00bb Subscribe to VOA News: https://bit.ly/3KIPysi\n\u00bb Watch more VOA News video: https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews\n\nVoice of America (VOA) is the largest U.S. international broadcaster, providing news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 236.8 million people.

    "description": "Why Palestinians in Gaza have suffered for decades.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOn October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping over 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes have killed, as of this video, over 6,400 Palestinians in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. \n\nSince 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.\n\nToday, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call \u201ccollective punishment\u201d as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.\n\nThis latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what\u2019s behind Israel\u2019s occupation and its blockade of Gaza. \n\nSources and readings: \n\nThank you for watching! We know we couldn\u2019t cover everything about the Gaza Strip, this was just a start. Below are a couple of sources and readings you might find helpful to learn more. \n\nGisha, an Israeli nonprofit that works to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians, has done so much research on the closure of Gaza and how it impacts Palestinians there.

Despite Hamas knowing that Israel is going to come back strong at them, they attacked. What was the reason that they did so. Whats the history of these organisations, how they came into existence, what is Fatah. What affect would this war have all over the world.

    "description": "The Israeli assassination attempt on Palestinian negotiators in Doha targeted a residential building in the Katara District, where senior Palestinian politburo members were reportedly meeting.\n\nWe\u2019ve identified and modeled the exact building that was hit.\nIf you look here, you\u2019ll see five buildings lined up, with a petrol station right next door.\n\nThe Strike was was aimed at Exactly the This Building Without damaging the Other Four including the Petrol Station\n\nThe strike was a success and carried out against the one in the middle, using a precision-guided weapons around 10 in Numbers to be precise all launched at the Same time.\npossibly an American made G P S guidance J dam, a Spike Laser Guided Bomb, or even a Rampage missile all used in Multiple combinations.\nBut the real question is\u2014how did Israel know exactly which building to strike?\nSince the start of the Gaza war on October 7, the Qatar Amiri Guard has been stationed around that structure 24 hours a day.\nThat heavy security presence was a giveaway.\n\nThe building, located next to the petrol station in Doha\u2019s Katara District, has been used to host high-profile Palestinian leaders.\n\nThe Amiri Guard\u2019s mission is to protect these key political figures and shield them from external threats\u2014part of Qatar\u2019s careful balancing act of hosting Hamas leadership while safeguarding its own security and diplomatic position in the region.\n\nSo how did the Israelis manage to penetrate this protective ring?\nAccording to intelligence assessments, Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet, tracked the Palestinian officials in Doha using a layered mix of intelligence techniques.\nThese likely included human sources on the ground, signals intelligence through intercepted communications, aerial or satellite surveillance, and possibly advanced cyber tools.\nCross-checking these inputs allowed Israel to pinpoint the exact building and confirm the timing of the Palestinian leadership meeting.\nThis set the stage for a precision strike designed to minimize civilian losses while focusing on senior Palestinian targets.\nThe operation also highlights how difficult such a mission is from a purely technical standpoint.\nThe flight distance from Israel to Doha is roughly 1200 miles this is around 2,000 kilometers one way\u2014well beyond the combat radius of fully armed Israeli fighter jets.\nThat means mid-air refueling wasn\u2019t just helpful, it was essential.\nAbout 15 Israeli fighters are believed to have been involved in the strike mission, flying more than a thousand miles each way.\nTo pull this off, the aircraft had to link up with Boeing 7 \"O' 7-based aerial tankers mid-flight.\nThese airborne refueling platforms gave the strike package the extra range and loiter time needed to reach Doha, conduct the operation, and return safely.\nBoth the outbound and return legs required discreet refueling, most likely carried out over international or third-party airspace to avoid radar detection.\n\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/aitelly3d/\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/aitelly3d\n\nWe make it on Blender\nDownload it is free and Safe\nhttps://www.blender.org/download/\n\nPeace Out\n\nAs a small channel, we encourage you to share our videos. \n\nHowever, please be advised that any unofficial translations or editing of our work in any medium will be considered a breach of our intellectual property rights.\n\nWe apologize for the legal language, which arises from our experiences dealing with a lot of duplicated content. \n\nThis has been a result of big channels duplicating our Videos, ripping our original hard work, which we have created from scratch, from modeling to rigging to animation and  rendering.\n\n As a result, we've had to involve lawyers.\n#qatar #israel #hamas",

    "description": "MetroTV, Ketegangan antara Iran dan Israel memanas setelah Iran melancarkan serangan rudal ke Israel pada Selasa (24/6) dini hari. Serangan ini terjadi menyusul klaim Presiden Amerika Serikat, Donald Trump, mengenai kesepakatan \"gencatan senjata penuh dan total\" antara kedua negara. Banyak pihak khawatir konflik berkepanjangan ini dapat memicu krisis ekonomi global, terutama jika Iran memblokir Selat Hormuz yang akan mengganggu suplai minyak internasional dan menyebabkan harga minyak mentah melonjak.\n\nLalu, bagaimana sebaiknya sikap pemerintah untuk mengurangi dampak perang terhadap Indonesia? Sikap politik seperti apa yang harus digaungkan oleh Indonesia? Dan benarkah Indonesia tidak terhempas ledakan konflik di Timur Tengah?\n\nSaksikan #HOTROOMMETROTV \"ADA STRATEGI APA DI BALIK GENCATAN SENJATA?\" Rabu,25 Juni 2025, pukul 21.05 WIB LIVE di #MetroTV\n\n#Israel #Iran #Donaldtrump  #Russia #USA #AmerikaSerikat #DonaldTrump #Netanyahu #VladimirPutin\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow juga sosmed kami untuk mendapatkan update informasi  terkini!\n\n\nWebsite: https://www.metrotvnews.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/metrotv/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/metrotv/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/metro_tv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@metro_tv\nMetro Xtend: https://xtend.metrotvnews.com/",

Just days after Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions were shattered, the regime is scrambling, hiding behind threats while burying its top generals and scientists.

From cyberattacks crippling Tehran\u2019s banking sector to precision raids in Hebron, and from Trump\u2019s strategic conditions for sanctions relief to secret funerals in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Square, this is a sweeping look at a region in upheaval and the people shaping its future.
