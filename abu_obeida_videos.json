Meanwhile, the Houthis released a video which showed Yemenis dancing on the top deck of the ship named 'Galaxy Leader'.

    "description": "Yüzünü kimse görmedi. Gizliliği İsrail’i oldukça sinirlendiriyor. Bu bahsettiğim kişiyle ilgili bilgi çok sınırlı. Merak edenler için hemen söyleyeyim. Profil’in bu bölümünde size Hamas’ın Sözcüsü Ebu Ubeyde’yi anlatacağım. İsrail’in Gazze’deki sivil, savunmasız halkı bombalaması masumların ve özellikle kadınların, çocukların hayatını kaybetmesinin üzerinden bir ay geçti. Bunun ne kadar süreceği belli değil. Saldırılar siz bu videoyu izlerken de maalesef hala devam ediyor. Bunun önüne geçmek ve orada yaşananlara son vermek için herkes elinden geleni yapıyor. Gazze halkının direnişine ortak olan, son yayınladığı videoyla da özgürlüklerini alana kadar savaşmaya devam edeceklerini söyleyen Kassam Tugayları'nın resmi medya sözcüsü olarak bilinen Ebu Hamza’nın hikayesi de oldukça gizemli. Kimisi onu Ebu Ubeyde olarak da tanıyor. Hamas'ın psikolojik ve medya savaşının ana arteri olarak görülmesi nedeniyle İsrail'in suikast listelerinde en çok aranan kişilerden biri. Halife Ömer bin Hattab döneminde Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabe Ebu Ubeyde bin Cerrah'dan dolayı kendisine Ebu Ubeyde lakabı verilmiş. Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı ve görünüşü bilinmiyor bununla birlikte, kendisi ve hayatıyla ilgili detaylar veya kişisel bilgiler yok olmasa bile neredeyse yok denecek kadar az.Medya kuruluşlarında veya yayınladığı görsel açıklamalarda yüzünü göstermiyor. Yüzünü açacak mı? O keyfiyenin altındaki kişi gerçekte kim? Bu da oldukça merak edilen sorulardan biri.

    "description": "Security forces of the Palestinian resistance have cautioned the public against recent 'Israeli' claims suggesting that Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, had been assassinated in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the resistance, these rumors are part of a deliberate 'Israeli' campaign designed to serve intelligence and psychological objectives.\n\nThe statement highlighted that 'Israeli' media is heavily controlled by the military and intelligence agencies, and nothing is published without prior security approval. Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

The use of Abu Obaida’s voice along with the alarms appears to be a deliberate psychological tactic aimed at intimidating local residents.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "title": "Uncertainty surrounds Qassam's spokesperson Abu Obaida as rumors of injury or death surge online",
    "description": "Amid rapid developments following the Gaza ceasefire, uncertainty has returned over the fate of Al-Qassam Brigades’ military spokesperson, Abu Obaida. His prolonged absence has sparked a storm of rumors and speculation across social media platforms.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the X platform (formerly Twitter) has seen a surge of Arabic posts exceeding 50,000 interactions. Reports have ranged from claims of “serious injury” following an assassination attempt to unconfirmed statements of his safety, turning Abu Obaida’s status into a heated topic and a psychological battleground online.\n\nRumors Surge: “Severely Injured” or “Confirmed Martyrdom”?\nThe rumors intensified on Tuesday evening, with posts claiming to convey a “message from an Al-Qassam leader” stating that Abu Obaida had sustained a “serious injury from an attack” but was “under specialized medical care and in stable condition,” adding that the assassination attempt had failed. These claims were widely circulated and accompanied by prayers for his recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, other voices suggested that he may have been martyred, arguing that his weeks-long absence is the strongest indicator. Activists cautioned against falling for what they described as a “psychological warfare” tactic by 'Israel', urging the public to wait for an official statement.\n\nConcern, Prayers, and Faith in the Resistance\nThe conflicting rumors have sparked widespread concern and prayers across Arab and Palestinian communities. X has been flooded with posts asking for Abu Obaida’s safety, while others shared clips of his previous speeches, emphasizing his symbolic importance.\n\nAt the same time, many expressed confidence in his survival, viewing the silence from the resistance as a deliberate tactic. One user wrote, “The mistake of revealing resistance leaders during the truce won’t be repeated. God willing, Abu Obaida is alive, and when the war officially ends, he will deliver the victory speech at the Saraya Square in Gaza.”\n\nDigital Battlefield: Psychological Warfare Online\nAnalysts say the past 24 hours illustrate a new chapter in the psychological warfare between Hamas and 'Israel'. In the absence of official information, digital platforms have become a key battleground where each side seeks to shape narratives and influence public morale.\n\nOn one hand, 'Israel' reportedly spreads rumors of assassination or injury to sow doubt and demoralize supporters of Hamas. On the other, Hamas follows a “strategic ambiguity” approach, letting silence generate speculation and maintaining the initiative in the psychological arena. In this information vacuum, Abu Obaida’s fate remains unknown, yet he continues to symbolize steadfastness in the eyes of those who support him.\n\nHistorical Context: The Green Symbol of Resistance\nAbu Obaida, the nom de guerre of Al-Qassam’s military spokesperson, became the most prominent media face of the resistance after announcing Operation Aqsa Typhoon on October 7, 2023.\n\nHe is known for speeches that combine warnings to 'Israel' with messages of hope for supporters of the resistance. This role has made him a primary target, with 'Israel' claiming in August 2025 that he had been killed in an airstrike, a claim never officially confirmed by Hamas. His continued absence contributes to the deliberate ambiguity surrounding resistance leadership.\n\nAnalysts note that this intentional mystery forms part of a security strategy aimed at protecting leadership while unsettling the enemy.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Abu Obeida, spokesperson of Hamas’ Al Qassam Brigades, appeared in a new video Monday, defying Israeli claims of his assassination. The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children.

    "description": "Amid rapid developments following the Gaza ceasefire, uncertainty has returned over the fate of Al-Qassam Brigades’ military spokesperson, Abu Obaida. His prolonged absence has sparked a storm of rumors and speculation across social media platforms.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the X platform (formerly Twitter) has seen a surge of Arabic posts exceeding 50,000 interactions. Reports have ranged from claims of “serious injury” following an assassination attempt to unconfirmed statements of his safety, turning Abu Obaida’s status into a heated topic and a psychological battleground online.\n\nRumors Surge: “Severely Injured” or “Confirmed Martyrdom”?\nThe rumors intensified on Tuesday evening, with posts claiming to convey a “message from an Al-Qassam leader” stating that Abu Obaida had sustained a “serious injury from an attack” but was “under specialized medical care and in stable condition,” adding that the assassination attempt had failed. These claims were widely circulated and accompanied by prayers for his recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, other voices suggested that he may have been martyred, arguing that his weeks-long absence is the strongest indicator. Activists cautioned against falling for what they described as a “psychological warfare” tactic by 'Israel', urging the public to wait for an official statement.\n\nConcern, Prayers, and Faith in the Resistance\nThe conflicting rumors have sparked widespread concern and prayers across Arab and Palestinian communities. X has been flooded with posts asking for Abu Obaida’s safety, while others shared clips of his previous speeches, emphasizing his symbolic importance.\n\nAt the same time, many expressed confidence in his survival, viewing the silence from the resistance as a deliberate tactic. One user wrote, “The mistake of revealing resistance leaders during the truce won’t be repeated. God willing, Abu Obaida is alive, and when the war officially ends, he will deliver the victory speech at the Saraya Square in Gaza.”\n\nDigital Battlefield: Psychological Warfare Online\nAnalysts say the past 24 hours illustrate a new chapter in the psychological warfare between Hamas and 'Israel'. In the absence of official information, digital platforms have become a key battleground where each side seeks to shape narratives and influence public morale.\n\nOn one hand, 'Israel' reportedly spreads rumors of assassination or injury to sow doubt and demoralize supporters of Hamas. On the other, Hamas follows a “strategic ambiguity” approach, letting silence generate speculation and maintaining the initiative in the psychological arena. In this information vacuum, Abu Obaida’s fate remains unknown, yet he continues to symbolize steadfastness in the eyes of those who support him.\n\nHistorical Context: The Green Symbol of Resistance\nAbu Obaida, the nom de guerre of Al-Qassam’s military spokesperson, became the most prominent media face of the resistance after announcing Operation Aqsa Typhoon on October 7, 2023.\n\nHe is known for speeches that combine warnings to 'Israel' with messages of hope for supporters of the resistance. This role has made him a primary target, with 'Israel' claiming in August 2025 that he had been killed in an airstrike, a claim never officially confirmed by Hamas. His continued absence contributes to the deliberate ambiguity surrounding resistance leadership.\n\nAnalysts note that this intentional mystery forms part of a security strategy aimed at protecting leadership while unsettling the enemy.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "title": "Abu Obaida: Netanyahu rejected full exchange deal because remaining captives are soldiers",
    "description": "Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, appeared in a newly released video on Friday, marking his first public statement since March 6, 2025.\n\nIn the video, he said four months had passed since the “Israeli” military resumed its aggression on Gaza, accusing “Israel” of betraying the terms of a previously agreed deal with the resistance.\n\nHe said that 'Israel' violated the truce and overturned commitments made during negotiations, leading to a renewed escalation in the aggression, in reference to \"Israel's\" surprise attack on Gaza in March during a declared ceasefire between the two parties.\n\nAbu Obaida said Al-Qassam fighters have killed or wounded hundreds of “Israeli” soldiers in recent months, while thousands more have reportedly suffered psychological trauma and shock. He added that the resistance has introduced new tactics and methods, drawing lessons from what he described as the longest war in the history of the Palestinian people.\n\nHe revealed that fighters have attempted several operations in recent weeks aimed at capturing “Israeli” soldiers. Capturing soldiers has been a long-standing goal for the group, often used to negotiate prisoner exchanges.\n\nAbu Obaida described Gaza’s armed resistance as “the greatest military school for a people resisting occupation in modern history,” affirming that they remain fully prepared to continue a prolonged war of attrition against the occupation, regardless of the form or strategy of future assaults.\n\nHe said the current strategy of Al-Qassam’s leadership is to inflict maximum losses on “Israeli” forces, carry out high-impact operations, and pursue the capture of soldiers.\n\nIn a regional message, he strongly criticized Arab leaders for their silence, saying: “The enemy would not have committed genocide in full view of the nation’s leaders unless it was assured of impunity, guaranteed silence, and bought betrayal.”\n\nHe stressed that no one was exempt from the responsibility of the bloodshed: “We do not absolve anyone. Everyone who can act, according to their ability and influence, must do so.”\n\nHe also praised Yemen’s Ansar Allah (Houthis), calling them “truthful brothers” who forced the enemy to face a new front and “exposed the cowardice of those who remain passive.”\n\nAbu Obaida extended his thanks to “all the free people around the world” who have shown solidarity and attempted to break the siege on Gaza despite risks.\n\nHe reiterated support for the Palestinian negotiating delegation in indirect talks with “Israel,” stating that Hamas had offered a comprehensive deal to release all enemy captives at once.\n\n“War criminal Netanyahu and his ministers rejected our offer. It became clear they are not interested in the fate of their soldiers,” he said, accusing the 'Israeli' leadership of preparing the public for the possibility that all prisoners might be dead.\n\nHe concluded by expressing hope that the ongoing negotiations would lead to a deal ensuring an end to what he called a “genocidal war,” the withdrawal of occupying forces, and urgent humanitarian relief for Gaza.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n#shortfeed #shorts #viralvideo",

    "description": "Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida has issued a chilling warning to Israel, vowing intensified guerrilla warfare in Gaza. The Al-Qassam Brigades claim near-successful attempts to capture IDF soldiers and report hundreds of Israeli casualties. Hamas threatens to halt partial deals if indirect talks fail and reiterates its hostage exchange offer for a full ceasefire. Accusing Israel of war crimes and psychological warfare, the group condemned Arab leaders for silence and praised Yemen’s Ansarallah for striking Israeli-linked targets in solidarity with Gaza.

    "description": "Hamas has issued a chilling warning that Israeli troops will be killed or captured if Israel pushes deeper into Gaza City. Abu Obeida, the spokesperson of Hamas’s al-Qassam Brigades, declared that occupying Gaza City would “cost the enemy in the blood of its soldiers” and increase the number of captives. Hours later, Hamas fighters ambushed Israeli forces in Gaza’s Zaytoun neighborhood, killing at least one soldier, wounding nine, and reportedly capturing four. The Israeli military confirmed it has begun the “initial stages” of occupying Gaza City, declaring it a combat zone. Experts call the ambush a major setback for Israel’s military campaign, as heavy clashes rage and helicopters evacuate wounded troops. Since October 7, Israel’s war has killed over 63,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. The UN warns that seizing Gaza City could displace nearly one million civilians, further deepening the humanitarian catastrophe.\r\n\r\n#Hamas #Israel #Gaza #GazaCity #BreakingNews #MiddleEast #War #Conflict #AbuObeida #Palestine #Zelensky #Netanyahu #Resistance #Military #Ceasefire #UN #WarCrimes #PalestinianCrisis #IsraelGazaWar #Breaking\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

    "description": "The Israeli Defense Forces claim to have killed Abu Obeida, the masked spokesman of Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, in a Gaza strike on August 30th. Long considered the “hidden face” of Hamas, Obeida has been a symbol of resistance since 2006, when he rose to prominence after the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. His identity was never revealed publicly until IDF released an estimated image. Palestinians viewed him as a hero, while Israel marked him as a top target. His death, if confirmed, marks a major blow to Hamas. \r\n\r\n#AbuObeida #Hamas #IDF #GazaWar #MiddleEast #BreakingNews #TelAviv #Israel #Palestine #WarUpdate #MaskedHero #Resistance #AlQassam #MilitaryStrike #TopTarget #TerrorGroup #IsraelHamasConflict #Gaza #Sinwar #Houthis #MiddleEastWar #HamasSpokesman #PsyOps #WarNews #IsraelDefenceForces #Airstrike #ConflictNews #GlobalSecurity #BreakingStory #WarInMiddleEast\n\nAlso Read\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid Domestic and International Criticism :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825995.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid Domestic and International Concerns :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825985.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid International Criticism :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825981.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The masked spokesman’s latest video, of unclear recording date, reignited speculation. Just days earlier, Obeida warned Israel of bloodshed and hostage risks if Gaza City’s offensive continued.

    "title": "Uncertainty surrounds Qassam's spokesperson Abu Obaida as rumors of injury or death surge online",
    "description": "Amid rapid developments following the Gaza ceasefire, uncertainty has returned over the fate of Al-Qassam Brigades’ military spokesperson, Abu Obaida. His prolonged absence has sparked a storm of rumors and speculation across social media platforms.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the X platform (formerly Twitter) has seen a surge of Arabic posts exceeding 50,000 interactions. Reports have ranged from claims of “serious injury” following an assassination attempt to unconfirmed statements of his safety, turning Abu Obaida’s status into a heated topic and a psychological battleground online.\n\nRumors Surge: “Severely Injured” or “Confirmed Martyrdom”?\nThe rumors intensified on Tuesday evening, with posts claiming to convey a “message from an Al-Qassam leader” stating that Abu Obaida had sustained a “serious injury from an attack” but was “under specialized medical care and in stable condition,” adding that the assassination attempt had failed. These claims were widely circulated and accompanied by prayers for his recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, other voices suggested that he may have been martyred, arguing that his weeks-long absence is the strongest indicator. Activists cautioned against falling for what they described as a “psychological warfare” tactic by 'Israel', urging the public to wait for an official statement.\n\nConcern, Prayers, and Faith in the Resistance\nThe conflicting rumors have sparked widespread concern and prayers across Arab and Palestinian communities. X has been flooded with posts asking for Abu Obaida’s safety, while others shared clips of his previous speeches, emphasizing his symbolic importance.\n\nAt the same time, many expressed confidence in his survival, viewing the silence from the resistance as a deliberate tactic. One user wrote, “The mistake of revealing resistance leaders during the truce won’t be repeated. God willing, Abu Obaida is alive, and when the war officially ends, he will deliver the victory speech at the Saraya Square in Gaza.”\n\nDigital Battlefield: Psychological Warfare Online\nAnalysts say the past 24 hours illustrate a new chapter in the psychological warfare between Hamas and 'Israel'. In the absence of official information, digital platforms have become a key battleground where each side seeks to shape narratives and influence public morale.\n\nOn one hand, 'Israel' reportedly spreads rumors of assassination or injury to sow doubt and demoralize supporters of Hamas. On the other, Hamas follows a “strategic ambiguity” approach, letting silence generate speculation and maintaining the initiative in the psychological arena. In this information vacuum, Abu Obaida’s fate remains unknown, yet he continues to symbolize steadfastness in the eyes of those who support him.\n\nHistorical Context: The Green Symbol of Resistance\nAbu Obaida, the nom de guerre of Al-Qassam’s military spokesperson, became the most prominent media face of the resistance after announcing Operation Aqsa Typhoon on October 7, 2023.\n\nHe is known for speeches that combine warnings to 'Israel' with messages of hope for supporters of the resistance. This role has made him a primary target, with 'Israel' claiming in August 2025 that he had been killed in an airstrike, a claim never officially confirmed by Hamas. His continued absence contributes to the deliberate ambiguity surrounding resistance leadership.\n\nAnalysts note that this intentional mystery forms part of a security strategy aimed at protecting leadership while unsettling the enemy.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Abu Obaida is back—and his reappearance has thrown Israel’s war narrative into chaos. Just days ago, the Israeli military announced with confidence that it had finally killed the elusive Hamas spokesperson in a precision strike on Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood. Reports swirled that not only Abu Obaida, but also his wife and children, were dead. Israeli media carried the news with relief, while even Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya cited sources saying the mission was successful. For a moment, it seemed like Israel had eliminated one of Hamas’s most symbolic figures.\n#israel #israelpalestineconflict #israelhamaswar #hamas #hamasvsisrael \n\nWelcome to TimesXP, your go-to source for the latest international news with a special focus on the United States! 🌍🇺🇸\n\nWe bring you up-to-date coverage on key global events, breaking news, and in-depth reports that matter to you.

This news has been broadcast by several Israeli media outlets, including Al-Arabiya Channel.

In his address, he accused Israel of obstructing ongoing indirect negotiations, mediated by Qatar since July 6, aimed at reaching a temporary ceasefire and securing the release of hostages held in Gaza.\nHe expressed full support for the Palestinian resistance delegation and reaffirmed Hamas’s readiness to conclude a comprehensive deal that would involve the release of all captives simultaneously. However, he blamed Israeli leadership, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting these offers and questioned their sincerity in seeking the return of the hostages.\n\nCatch MEE LIVE, our new biweekly live news programme, where we take a look at the news shaping our world through breaking coverage, expert analysis and hard-hitting interviews. \n\nMEE LIVE: Tuesday & Thursday | 12pm ET | 5pm BST | \nJoin the conversation at MEELive@middleeasteye.org\n\nSupport stories that matter.

    "title": "Abu Obaida: Netanyahu rejected full exchange deal because remaining captives are soldiers",
    "description": "Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, appeared in a newly released video on Friday, marking his first public statement since March 6, 2025.\n\nIn the video, he said four months had passed since the “Israeli” military resumed its aggression on Gaza, accusing “Israel” of betraying the terms of a previously agreed deal with the resistance.\n\nHe said that 'Israel' violated the truce and overturned commitments made during negotiations, leading to a renewed escalation in the aggression, in reference to \"Israel's\" surprise attack on Gaza in March during a declared ceasefire between the two parties.\n\nAbu Obaida said Al-Qassam fighters have killed or wounded hundreds of “Israeli” soldiers in recent months, while thousands more have reportedly suffered psychological trauma and shock. He added that the resistance has introduced new tactics and methods, drawing lessons from what he described as the longest war in the history of the Palestinian people.\n\nHe revealed that fighters have attempted several operations in recent weeks aimed at capturing “Israeli” soldiers. Capturing soldiers has been a long-standing goal for the group, often used to negotiate prisoner exchanges.\n\nAbu Obaida described Gaza’s armed resistance as “the greatest military school for a people resisting occupation in modern history,” affirming that they remain fully prepared to continue a prolonged war of attrition against the occupation, regardless of the form or strategy of future assaults.\n\nHe said the current strategy of Al-Qassam’s leadership is to inflict maximum losses on “Israeli” forces, carry out high-impact operations, and pursue the capture of soldiers.\n\nIn a regional message, he strongly criticized Arab leaders for their silence, saying: “The enemy would not have committed genocide in full view of the nation’s leaders unless it was assured of impunity, guaranteed silence, and bought betrayal.”\n\nHe stressed that no one was exempt from the responsibility of the bloodshed: “We do not absolve anyone. Everyone who can act, according to their ability and influence, must do so.”\n\nHe also praised Yemen’s Ansar Allah (Houthis), calling them “truthful brothers” who forced the enemy to face a new front and “exposed the cowardice of those who remain passive.”\n\nAbu Obaida extended his thanks to “all the free people around the world” who have shown solidarity and attempted to break the siege on Gaza despite risks.\n\nHe reiterated support for the Palestinian negotiating delegation in indirect talks with “Israel,” stating that Hamas had offered a comprehensive deal to release all enemy captives at once.\n\n“War criminal Netanyahu and his ministers rejected our offer. It became clear they are not interested in the fate of their soldiers,” he said, accusing the 'Israeli' leadership of preparing the public for the possibility that all prisoners might be dead.\n\nHe concluded by expressing hope that the ongoing negotiations would lead to a deal ensuring an end to what he called a “genocidal war,” the withdrawal of occupying forces, and urgent humanitarian relief for Gaza.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n#shortfeed #shorts #viralvideo",

    "description": "Hamas' military wing leader Abu Obaida has issued a fervent call for a month of \"jihad and victories\" during Ramadan, marking his lengthiest address since the October 7 massacre in Israel. In his speech, Obaida declared Ramadan as a month of obedience, jihad, and triumphs. This proclamation comes amidst escalating tensions, with President Biden acknowledging difficulties in securing a Gaza ceasefire. Obaida's rallying cry urges mobilization towards the Al-Aqsa Mosque, asserting its significance and calling for resistance against Israeli occupation. Meanwhile, Biden's optimism for a pre-Ramadan ceasefire wanes, expressing concern over potential violence in East Jerusalem as the holy month approaches. The Al-Aqsa Mosque dispute intensified following Israeli Minister Ben Gvir's statement, which Hamas swiftly responded to by urging protest marches to the mosque. Although Israel clarified Palestinians' access to Al-Aqsa on March 8, restrictions persist for West Bank Palestinians amid ongoing conflict. Ramadan, slated to commence imminently, underscores the region's fraught dynamics.\n\n#israel #gaza #usa #america #britain \n\nSubscribe to The Times of India's YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/WgIatu\nFor daily news & updates and exclusive stories, follow the Times of India\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TimesofIndia\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/timesofindia/\nDownload the app: http://toi.in/3SLUCa80\nFollow the TOI WhatsApp channel: https://bit.ly/3RYl0J9\n\nFollow TOI+ for well-researched and in-depth news and analysis\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/timesofindiaplus\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/TOIPlus\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/toi_plus/",

    "description": "Yüzünü kimse görmedi. Gizliliği İsrail’i oldukça sinirlendiriyor. Bu bahsettiğim kişiyle ilgili bilgi çok sınırlı. Merak edenler için hemen söyleyeyim. Profil’in bu bölümünde size Hamas’ın Sözcüsü Ebu Ubeyde’yi anlatacağım. İsrail’in Gazze’deki sivil, savunmasız halkı bombalaması masumların ve özellikle kadınların, çocukların hayatını kaybetmesinin üzerinden bir ay geçti. Bunun ne kadar süreceği belli değil. Saldırılar siz bu videoyu izlerken de maalesef hala devam ediyor. Bunun önüne geçmek ve orada yaşananlara son vermek için herkes elinden geleni yapıyor. Gazze halkının direnişine ortak olan, son yayınladığı videoyla da özgürlüklerini alana kadar savaşmaya devam edeceklerini söyleyen Kassam Tugayları'nın resmi medya sözcüsü olarak bilinen Ebu Hamza’nın hikayesi de oldukça gizemli. Kimisi onu Ebu Ubeyde olarak da tanıyor. Hamas'ın psikolojik ve medya savaşının ana arteri olarak görülmesi nedeniyle İsrail'in suikast listelerinde en çok aranan kişilerden biri. Halife Ömer bin Hattab döneminde Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabe Ebu Ubeyde bin Cerrah'dan dolayı kendisine Ebu Ubeyde lakabı verilmiş. Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı ve görünüşü bilinmiyor bununla birlikte, kendisi ve hayatıyla ilgili detaylar veya kişisel bilgiler yok olmasa bile neredeyse yok denecek kadar az.Medya kuruluşlarında veya yayınladığı görsel açıklamalarda yüzünü göstermiyor. Yüzünü açacak mı? O keyfiyenin altındaki kişi gerçekte kim? Bu da oldukça merak edilen sorulardan biri.

    "description": "Security forces of the Palestinian resistance have cautioned the public against recent 'Israeli' claims suggesting that Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, had been assassinated in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the resistance, these rumors are part of a deliberate 'Israeli' campaign designed to serve intelligence and psychological objectives.\n\nThe statement highlighted that 'Israeli' media is heavily controlled by the military and intelligence agencies, and nothing is published without prior security approval. Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Abu Obeida, spokesperson of Hamas’ Al Qassam Brigades, appeared in a new video Monday, defying Israeli claims of his assassination. The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The masked spokesman’s latest video, of unclear recording date, reignited speculation. Just days earlier, Obeida warned Israel of bloodshed and hostage risks if Gaza City’s offensive continued.

Using heavy mortars and guerrilla tactics, Hamas dismantled an IDF company near Hassan al-Banna mosque, halting Israeli advances. The IDF has now admitted losing 900 soldiers in the conflict, underscoring Hamas’ resilience. Tensions grow as Israel faces internal rifts, with PM Netanyahu clashing with IDF Chief Zamir over a possible hostage deal.

    "title": "Uncertainty surrounds Qassam's spokesperson Abu Obaida as rumors of injury or death surge online",
    "description": "Amid rapid developments following the Gaza ceasefire, uncertainty has returned over the fate of Al-Qassam Brigades’ military spokesperson, Abu Obaida. His prolonged absence has sparked a storm of rumors and speculation across social media platforms.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the X platform (formerly Twitter) has seen a surge of Arabic posts exceeding 50,000 interactions. Reports have ranged from claims of “serious injury” following an assassination attempt to unconfirmed statements of his safety, turning Abu Obaida’s status into a heated topic and a psychological battleground online.\n\nRumors Surge: “Severely Injured” or “Confirmed Martyrdom”?\nThe rumors intensified on Tuesday evening, with posts claiming to convey a “message from an Al-Qassam leader” stating that Abu Obaida had sustained a “serious injury from an attack” but was “under specialized medical care and in stable condition,” adding that the assassination attempt had failed. These claims were widely circulated and accompanied by prayers for his recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, other voices suggested that he may have been martyred, arguing that his weeks-long absence is the strongest indicator. Activists cautioned against falling for what they described as a “psychological warfare” tactic by 'Israel', urging the public to wait for an official statement.\n\nConcern, Prayers, and Faith in the Resistance\nThe conflicting rumors have sparked widespread concern and prayers across Arab and Palestinian communities. X has been flooded with posts asking for Abu Obaida’s safety, while others shared clips of his previous speeches, emphasizing his symbolic importance.\n\nAt the same time, many expressed confidence in his survival, viewing the silence from the resistance as a deliberate tactic. One user wrote, “The mistake of revealing resistance leaders during the truce won’t be repeated. God willing, Abu Obaida is alive, and when the war officially ends, he will deliver the victory speech at the Saraya Square in Gaza.”\n\nDigital Battlefield: Psychological Warfare Online\nAnalysts say the past 24 hours illustrate a new chapter in the psychological warfare between Hamas and 'Israel'. In the absence of official information, digital platforms have become a key battleground where each side seeks to shape narratives and influence public morale.\n\nOn one hand, 'Israel' reportedly spreads rumors of assassination or injury to sow doubt and demoralize supporters of Hamas. On the other, Hamas follows a “strategic ambiguity” approach, letting silence generate speculation and maintaining the initiative in the psychological arena. In this information vacuum, Abu Obaida’s fate remains unknown, yet he continues to symbolize steadfastness in the eyes of those who support him.\n\nHistorical Context: The Green Symbol of Resistance\nAbu Obaida, the nom de guerre of Al-Qassam’s military spokesperson, became the most prominent media face of the resistance after announcing Operation Aqsa Typhoon on October 7, 2023.\n\nHe is known for speeches that combine warnings to 'Israel' with messages of hope for supporters of the resistance. This role has made him a primary target, with 'Israel' claiming in August 2025 that he had been killed in an airstrike, a claim never officially confirmed by Hamas. His continued absence contributes to the deliberate ambiguity surrounding resistance leadership.\n\nAnalysts note that this intentional mystery forms part of a security strategy aimed at protecting leadership while unsettling the enemy.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Israel delivers a major blow to Hamas with the elimination of Abu Obeida, Hamas's masked mouthpiece and chief propagandist. What does his death mean for the war, the region and the battle of narratives? Find out in this explosive new episode of “The Quad” hosted by Israel innovation envoy Fleur Hassan-Nahoum.\n\nJoining the panel is Arab-Israeli activist Yoseph Haddad, who offers powerful insights into the shifting mindset among Arab communities in Israel and the growing calls from Gazans themselves to be liberated from Hamas rule. The conversation also tackles the corrosive role of Al Jazeera and Qatari-funded propaganda in shaping global opinion, as well as the urgent need for media accountability.\n\nThe discussion delves into the hypocrisy of international institutions like the UN and UNRWA, whose double standards and blind spots continue to fuel misinformation and obstruct peace. From the use of children as human shields in Gaza schools to the moral corruption of terrorist regimes, our hosts don’t shy away from hard truths. They also spotlight the rise of extremism in Western capitals, questioning whether mass immigration without cultural integration is putting democratic values at risk.\n\nFinally, they discuss whether targeted strikes on terrorist leaders, including the Houthis, can alter the strategic equation and how media bias continues to endanger Israel’s legitimacy on the world stage. As always, the show wraps with the team’s picks for “hero” and “scumbag” of the week, plus a sweet (and slightly spicy) side note involving...baklava.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 - Israel Eliminates Hamas Spokesman Abu Obeida\n04:10 - The Power of Propaganda: Why Abu Obeida Mattered\n08:20 - Gaza Reacts: Has the Tide Turned Against Hamas?\n13:00 - The Houthis, Child Soldiers & Western Hypocrisy\n17:25 - Can Gaza Ever Change?

In his address, he accused Israel of obstructing ongoing indirect negotiations, mediated by Qatar since July 6, aimed at reaching a temporary ceasefire and securing the release of hostages held in Gaza.\nHe expressed full support for the Palestinian resistance delegation and reaffirmed Hamas’s readiness to conclude a comprehensive deal that would involve the release of all captives simultaneously. However, he blamed Israeli leadership, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting these offers and questioned their sincerity in seeking the return of the hostages.\n\nCatch MEE LIVE, our new biweekly live news programme, where we take a look at the news shaping our world through breaking coverage, expert analysis and hard-hitting interviews. \n\nMEE LIVE: Tuesday & Thursday | 12pm ET | 5pm BST | \nJoin the conversation at MEELive@middleeasteye.org\n\nSupport stories that matter.

Reports claim Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida was killed, but while IDF and Shin Bet call it a “key Hamas leader” strike, Hamas remains silent, calling the rumors “psychological warfare.” Civilians paid the price—with at least seven killed, dozens feared buried alive, and rescuers racing against time.

Al-Qassam spokesperson Abu Obeida warned of a prolonged attrition war if Israeli tanks push deeper into Gaza. The latest attack underscores Israel’s struggle to fully contain Hamas, signaling a new phase of resistance from Gaza’s militants.\r\n\r\n#Hamas #Israel #Gaza #Ceasefire #RocketAttack #IDF #MiddleEastConflict #WarInGaza #BorderTensions #Palestine #IsraeliArmy #AlQassam #AbuObeida #Resistance #AttritionWar #GuerrillaWarfare #BreakingNews #ConflictZone #IsraelGazaWar #MideastCrisis #MilitaryUpdate #Terrorism #DefenseNews #RocketStrike #PeaceTalksFail #Kissufim #IDFCasualties #SilentOperations #GazaResistance #SecurityCrisis\n\nAlso Read\n\nIsrael And Syria Agree To ceasefire: US Ambassador To Turkey :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/israel-and-syria-agree-to-ceasefire-us-ambassador-to-turkey-011-7805781.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n‘She Used Me for Money’: Israeli Father’s Struggle to See Daughters After Gokarna Rescue :: https://www.oneindia.com/bengaluru/she-used-me-for-money-israeli-father-s-struggle-to-see-daughters-after-gokarna-rescue-011-7804789.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nIsrael's Troop Presence in Gaza Complicates Ceasefire Negotiations with Hamas :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/israel-troops-gaza-complicates-truce-talks-011-7796581.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

    "title": "HAMAS Spokesperson Abu Obeida WARNS Netanyahu of More IDF Deaths | ‘This Is Just the Beginning’",
    "description": "Hamas Warns 'More Captures Coming' After Killing 5 Israeli Soldiers In Gaza | Netanyahu Shaken\r\nIn a meticulously planned operation, Hamas forces have dealt a devastating blow to the IDF, raising critical questions about Israel's strategy in the ongoing war. This report details the attack and its significant fallout.\r\n\r\nIn a major escalation in the Israel-Gaza war, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, has claimed responsibility for a deadly ambush in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza. The operation involved a planned IED blast that targeted Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), resulting in the deaths of five soldiers and injuring fourteen others. This incident represents a significant tactical victory for Hamas and a blow to Israel's military prestige. The fallen soldiers included four from the 97th Netzah Yehuda Battalion and one from the Northern Gaza Brigade, with the IDF officially naming Staff Sgt. Noam Musgadian and Sgt. Moshe Frech among the deceased.\r\n\r\nFollowing the attack, Al-Qassam's spokesperson, Abu Obeida, released a defiant statement, warning of more Israeli losses to come. He declared the Beit Hanoun operation a \"heavy blow\" to Israel's ground capabilities and promised further captures of Israeli soldiers in future engagements. Obeida asserted that the resistance in Gaza remains strong and framed the ongoing conflict as a \"war of attrition\" that will continue to cost Israel both soldiers and international standing, calling the situation \"Netanyahu's biggest mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThis attack occurred under complex circumstances. According to an i24 News report, the ambush was triggered when an IDF medical unit entered the area to evacuate soldiers wounded in a prior engagement. The incident's timing is also critical, as it coincides with indirect ceasefire talks being held in Qatar between Israeli and Hamas representatives. The event underscores the persistent challenge Israel faces in containing Hamas, even two years into the conflict, and adds immense pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu's government. A report from RT News even claimed Netanyahu was furious upon hearing the news just before a dinner meeting with Donald Trump, highlighting the intense political pressure he is under.\r\n\r\n\r\n#IsraelHamasWar #Hamas #Gaza #IDF #BreakingNews #WorldNews #Netanyahu #Palestine #OneindiaNews #BeitHanoun\n\nAlso Read\n\nIsrael PM Netanyahu Faces Anger, And Tears In First Visit To Nir Oz Since Oct 7 Gaza Massacre :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/benjamin-netanyahu-visits-nir-oz-kibbutz-near-gaza-strip-011-7791019.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nMiddle East: UN Labels Gaza 'The Hungriest Place On Earth' :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/middle-east-un-labels-gaza-the-hungriest-place-on-earth-4168609.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nHamas Leader Muhammad Sinwar Killed In Israel's Air Strike :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/hamas-leader-muhammad-sinwar-killed-in-israels-air-strike-4156915.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Hamas’ military wing spokesperson, Abu Obeida, has re-emerged after four months of silence with a fiery televised address. Speaking for the first time since Israel renewed its military offensive in Gaza in March, Obeida condemned the Arab world's silence over the suffering in Gaza and accused them of betraying the Palestinian cause. His harsh words targeted not just Israel, but the Arab regimes he labelled as complicit.\r\n\r\nObeida also outlined Hamas' evolving battle strategy, revealing counter-operations to Israel’s “Gideon’s Chariots.” The speech, filled with warnings and a tone of defiance, has stunned many, especially coming amid rising tensions between Israel and Syria. His appearance comes as a symbolic message — Hamas is neither broken nor backing down. Watch the full speech to understand what’s next in this escalating conflict.\r\n\r\n#Hamas #AbuObaida #IsraelGazaWar #GazaUnderAttack #ArabWorld #MiddleEastConflict #IDF #Palestine #GideonsChariots #IsraelSyria #WarSpeech #ArabSilence #GazaNews #AbuObaidaSpeech #BreakingNews #HamasVsIDF #IsraelUpdates #HamasCounterstrike #PalestinianResistance #ArabBetrayal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

Tentaranya menjadi bahan cemoohan bagi anak bungsu Palestina,\" katanya, dikutip dari Al Jazeera.\n\n“Apa yang akan dilakukan oleh teknologi rudal, tank yang dibentengi, dan pesawat modern dengan senjata mematikannya di hadapan kekuatan keimanan seorang Mujahid yang menghabiskan dua bulan atau lebih di kompleks pertahanannya, menunggu kekuatan yang maju, menunggu untuk mengalahkan musuhnya dan menjalankan misinya, mengabdikan semua itu kepada Tuhan dan percaya pada keadilan tujuannya?” lanjutnya.\n\nKemudian, salam pidato itu, Abu Obaida juga menyinggung narasi yang digunakan oleh zionis sebelum mendirikan negara Israel di Palestina.\n\n\"Sapi merah dibawa sebagai implementasi dari mitos agama menjijikkan yang dirancang untuk menyerang perasaan seluruh bangsa di jantung Arabisme dan jalan nabinya dan kenaikannya ke surga,\" katanya.\n\nIa juga mengatakan perang di Jalur Gaza ini adalah seruan kepada setiap muslim untuk menyadari sifat konflik ini.\n\nYang mana, ia menyebut, latar belakang dan sifat pemerintahan zionis merupakan keturunan geng teroris Haganah.\n\nLebih lanjut, Abu Obaida juga mengatakan faksi perlawanan Palestina tidak mempunyai pilihan selain menggunakan kekuatan untuk mengingatkan dunia bahwa Palestina memiliki rakyat dan pejuang.\n\nDiketahui, setelah Operasi Banjir Al-Aqsa pada Sabtu (7/10/2023), Israel melancarkan serangan besar-besaran ke Jalur Gaza hingga hari ini.\n\nIsrael memperkirakan masih ada sekitar 137 sandera yang ditahan Hamas di Jalur Gaza.\n\nJumlah kematian warga Palestina di Jalur Gaza terhitung 23.968 hingga Senin (15/1/2024), sementara 1.200 kematian di wilayah Israel, yang direvisi oleh Israel menjadi 1.147 jiwa.\n\n(Tribun-Video.com/Tribunnews.com)\n\nArtikel ini telah tayang di Tribunnews.com dengan judul Perang Hari ke-100, Abu Ubaida: Lemahnya Tentara Israel, Nangis Ketakutan Hadapi Hamas, https://www.tribunnews.com/internasional/2024/01/15/perang-hari-ke-100-abu-ubaida-lemahnya-tentara-israel-nangis-ketakutan-hadapi-hamas?page=all.\nPenulis: Yunita Rahmayanti\nEditor: Garudea Prabawati\n\nHost: Nina Agustina\nVP: Ika Vidya\n\n\n#abuobaida #abuubaidah #hamas #idf #palestine #palestina #israel #gaza #hamasvsisrael #israelpalestineconflict",

    "description": "Abu Obeida, spokesperson of Hamas’ Al Qassam Brigades, appeared in a new video Monday, defying Israeli claims of his assassination. The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports.

    "description": "Security forces of the Palestinian resistance have cautioned the public against recent 'Israeli' claims suggesting that Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for Hamas’s armed wing, had been assassinated in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the resistance, these rumors are part of a deliberate 'Israeli' campaign designed to serve intelligence and psychological objectives.\n\nThe statement highlighted that 'Israeli' media is heavily controlled by the military and intelligence agencies, and nothing is published without prior security approval. Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

His harsh words targeted not just Israel, but the Arab regimes he labelled as complicit.\r\n\r\nObeida also outlined Hamas' evolving battle strategy, revealing counter-operations to Israel’s “Gideon’s Chariots.” The speech, filled with warnings and a tone of defiance, has stunned many, especially coming amid rising tensions between Israel and Syria. His appearance comes as a symbolic message — Hamas is neither broken nor backing down.

The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The masked spokesman’s latest video, of unclear recording date, reignited speculation. Just days earlier, Obeida warned Israel of bloodshed and hostage risks if Gaza City’s offensive continued.

    "title": "IDF Fails To Eliminate Abu Obaida? 1st Video Out From Al-Rimal As Hamas Breaks Silence After Strike",
    "description": "Gaza reels from chaotic scenes as first visuals emerge of bodies pulled from the rubble after Israel’s precision airstrike in al-Rimal. Reports claim Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida was killed, but while IDF and Shin Bet call it a “key Hamas leader” strike, Hamas remains silent, calling the rumors “psychological warfare.” Civilians paid the price—with at least seven killed, dozens feared buried alive, and rescuers racing against time. If Abu Obeida’s death is confirmed, it would be a huge symbolic blow to Hamas as Israeli operations intensify.\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS\n\n#AbuObeida #GazaStrike #Hamas #IDF #GazaWar #Rumors #AlRimal #WarCasualties #GazaCity\n\nAdd Hindustan Times as your preferred source on Google.

    "title": "HAMAS Spokesperson Abu Obeida WARNS Netanyahu of More IDF Deaths | ‘This Is Just the Beginning’",
    "description": "Hamas Warns 'More Captures Coming' After Killing 5 Israeli Soldiers In Gaza | Netanyahu Shaken\r\nIn a meticulously planned operation, Hamas forces have dealt a devastating blow to the IDF, raising critical questions about Israel's strategy in the ongoing war. This report details the attack and its significant fallout.\r\n\r\nIn a major escalation in the Israel-Gaza war, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, has claimed responsibility for a deadly ambush in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza. The operation involved a planned IED blast that targeted Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), resulting in the deaths of five soldiers and injuring fourteen others. This incident represents a significant tactical victory for Hamas and a blow to Israel's military prestige. The fallen soldiers included four from the 97th Netzah Yehuda Battalion and one from the Northern Gaza Brigade, with the IDF officially naming Staff Sgt. Noam Musgadian and Sgt. Moshe Frech among the deceased.\r\n\r\nFollowing the attack, Al-Qassam's spokesperson, Abu Obeida, released a defiant statement, warning of more Israeli losses to come. He declared the Beit Hanoun operation a \"heavy blow\" to Israel's ground capabilities and promised further captures of Israeli soldiers in future engagements. Obeida asserted that the resistance in Gaza remains strong and framed the ongoing conflict as a \"war of attrition\" that will continue to cost Israel both soldiers and international standing, calling the situation \"Netanyahu's biggest mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThis attack occurred under complex circumstances. According to an i24 News report, the ambush was triggered when an IDF medical unit entered the area to evacuate soldiers wounded in a prior engagement. The incident's timing is also critical, as it coincides with indirect ceasefire talks being held in Qatar between Israeli and Hamas representatives. The event underscores the persistent challenge Israel faces in containing Hamas, even two years into the conflict, and adds immense pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu's government. A report from RT News even claimed Netanyahu was furious upon hearing the news just before a dinner meeting with Donald Trump, highlighting the intense political pressure he is under.\r\n\r\n\r\n#IsraelHamasWar #Hamas #Gaza #IDF #BreakingNews #WorldNews #Netanyahu #Palestine #OneindiaNews #BeitHanoun\n\nAlso Read\n\nIsrael PM Netanyahu Faces Anger, And Tears In First Visit To Nir Oz Since Oct 7 Gaza Massacre :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/benjamin-netanyahu-visits-nir-oz-kibbutz-near-gaza-strip-011-7791019.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nMiddle East: UN Labels Gaza 'The Hungriest Place On Earth' :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/middle-east-un-labels-gaza-the-hungriest-place-on-earth-4168609.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nHamas Leader Muhammad Sinwar Killed In Israel's Air Strike :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/hamas-leader-muhammad-sinwar-killed-in-israels-air-strike-4156915.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

    "title": "Abu Obaida: Netanyahu rejected full exchange deal because remaining captives are soldiers",
    "description": "Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, appeared in a newly released video on Friday, marking his first public statement since March 6, 2025.\n\nIn the video, he said four months had passed since the “Israeli” military resumed its aggression on Gaza, accusing “Israel” of betraying the terms of a previously agreed deal with the resistance.\n\nHe said that 'Israel' violated the truce and overturned commitments made during negotiations, leading to a renewed escalation in the aggression, in reference to \"Israel's\" surprise attack on Gaza in March during a declared ceasefire between the two parties.\n\nAbu Obaida said Al-Qassam fighters have killed or wounded hundreds of “Israeli” soldiers in recent months, while thousands more have reportedly suffered psychological trauma and shock. He added that the resistance has introduced new tactics and methods, drawing lessons from what he described as the longest war in the history of the Palestinian people.\n\nHe revealed that fighters have attempted several operations in recent weeks aimed at capturing “Israeli” soldiers. Capturing soldiers has been a long-standing goal for the group, often used to negotiate prisoner exchanges.\n\nAbu Obaida described Gaza’s armed resistance as “the greatest military school for a people resisting occupation in modern history,” affirming that they remain fully prepared to continue a prolonged war of attrition against the occupation, regardless of the form or strategy of future assaults.\n\nHe said the current strategy of Al-Qassam’s leadership is to inflict maximum losses on “Israeli” forces, carry out high-impact operations, and pursue the capture of soldiers.\n\nIn a regional message, he strongly criticized Arab leaders for their silence, saying: “The enemy would not have committed genocide in full view of the nation’s leaders unless it was assured of impunity, guaranteed silence, and bought betrayal.”\n\nHe stressed that no one was exempt from the responsibility of the bloodshed: “We do not absolve anyone. Everyone who can act, according to their ability and influence, must do so.”\n\nHe also praised Yemen’s Ansar Allah (Houthis), calling them “truthful brothers” who forced the enemy to face a new front and “exposed the cowardice of those who remain passive.”\n\nAbu Obaida extended his thanks to “all the free people around the world” who have shown solidarity and attempted to break the siege on Gaza despite risks.\n\nHe reiterated support for the Palestinian negotiating delegation in indirect talks with “Israel,” stating that Hamas had offered a comprehensive deal to release all enemy captives at once.\n\n“War criminal Netanyahu and his ministers rejected our offer. It became clear they are not interested in the fate of their soldiers,” he said, accusing the 'Israeli' leadership of preparing the public for the possibility that all prisoners might be dead.\n\nHe concluded by expressing hope that the ongoing negotiations would lead to a deal ensuring an end to what he called a “genocidal war,” the withdrawal of occupying forces, and urgent humanitarian relief for Gaza.\n\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n#shortfeed #shorts #viralvideo",

In his address, he accused Israel of obstructing ongoing indirect negotiations, mediated by Qatar since July 6, aimed at reaching a temporary ceasefire and securing the release of hostages held in Gaza.\nHe expressed full support for the Palestinian resistance delegation and reaffirmed Hamas’s readiness to conclude a comprehensive deal that would involve the release of all captives simultaneously. However, he blamed Israeli leadership, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for rejecting these offers and questioned their sincerity in seeking the return of the hostages.\n\nCatch MEE LIVE, our new biweekly live news programme, where we take a look at the news shaping our world through breaking coverage, expert analysis and hard-hitting interviews. \n\nMEE LIVE: Tuesday & Thursday | 12pm ET | 5pm BST | \nJoin the conversation at MEELive@middleeasteye.org\n\nSupport stories that matter.

    "description": "Yüzünü kimse görmedi. Gizliliği İsrail’i oldukça sinirlendiriyor. Bu bahsettiğim kişiyle ilgili bilgi çok sınırlı. Merak edenler için hemen söyleyeyim. Profil’in bu bölümünde size Hamas’ın Sözcüsü Ebu Ubeyde’yi anlatacağım. İsrail’in Gazze’deki sivil, savunmasız halkı bombalaması masumların ve özellikle kadınların, çocukların hayatını kaybetmesinin üzerinden bir ay geçti. Bunun ne kadar süreceği belli değil. Saldırılar siz bu videoyu izlerken de maalesef hala devam ediyor. Bunun önüne geçmek ve orada yaşananlara son vermek için herkes elinden geleni yapıyor. Gazze halkının direnişine ortak olan, son yayınladığı videoyla da özgürlüklerini alana kadar savaşmaya devam edeceklerini söyleyen Kassam Tugayları'nın resmi medya sözcüsü olarak bilinen Ebu Hamza’nın hikayesi de oldukça gizemli. Kimisi onu Ebu Ubeyde olarak da tanıyor. Hamas'ın psikolojik ve medya savaşının ana arteri olarak görülmesi nedeniyle İsrail'in suikast listelerinde en çok aranan kişilerden biri. Halife Ömer bin Hattab döneminde Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabe Ebu Ubeyde bin Cerrah'dan dolayı kendisine Ebu Ubeyde lakabı verilmiş. Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı ve görünüşü bilinmiyor bununla birlikte, kendisi ve hayatıyla ilgili detaylar veya kişisel bilgiler yok olmasa bile neredeyse yok denecek kadar az.Medya kuruluşlarında veya yayınladığı görsel açıklamalarda yüzünü göstermiyor. Yüzünü açacak mı? O keyfiyenin altındaki kişi gerçekte kim? Bu da oldukça merak edilen sorulardan biri. Ebu Ubeyde’nin bilinen ve bilinmeyen tüm hikayesini GZT editörü Kübra Akçelik anlattı.\n\nVideoyu beğenin!

Hiçbir zaman yüzü açık olarak kamera karşısında olmadı. \n\nİsrail'in 2005 yılında Gazze'den çekilmesinin ardından Ebu Ubeyde resmi olarak Kassam'ın sözcüsü olarak atandı.\n\nEvi 2008, 2012, 2014 yıllarında ve Gazze'de şu an yaşanan saldırılarda birden fazla kez bombalandı. Filistinli çocukların supermanı olan Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı bilinmiyor. İsraillilere göre onun adı Huzeyfe Kalot.  \n\nPeki Gazzelilerin kahramanı, kendisini neden Ebu Ubeyde olarak tanıttı?\n\nEbu Ubeyde, Peygamberimizin cennetle müjdelediği sahabilerden biri. Öyle büyük bir sahabi ki Hz. Peygamber'in vefatı üzerine aralarında Hz. Ebû Bekir ve Hz. Ömer’in de bulunduğu bazı sahâbîler, Ebû Ubeyde’ye halife olarak biat etmek istediler. Fakat o, Hz. Ebubekir'in layık olduğunu söyleyerek reddetti. Hz. Peygamberin komutanlarından biri olan Ebu Ubeyde, Hz. Ömer döneminde Hâlid b. Velîd’in yerine orduların başkumandanlığına getirildi. Bu dönemde Dımaşk, Humus, Halep, Antakya ve Kudüs başta olmak üzere Suriye bölgesindeki birçok şehrin fethinde başkumandan oydu.\n\nEbu Ubeyde'nin, Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabinin adını alması sizce de manidar değil mi?\n\n#kudüs #ebuubeyde #filistin #gazze #gaza",

    "description": "Kanalıma Abone olun \n\nİzzeddin Kassam Tugayları'nın yeni askeri sözcüsünün konuşması: \"Müminler arasında Allah ile olan ahdine sadık kalanlar da vardır.\"\n\n(1) İzzeddin el-Kassam Tugayları'nın, askeri kanadının, bu akşam, Pazartesi günü yaptığı konuşmanın en önemli noktaları: Kassam Tugayları sizi şeref ve gurur diyarı, cihat, şehitlik, saflık ve zafer diyarı olan Gazze'den selamlıyor. Şeref diyarı Gazze'ye ait olmaktan ve peygamberlerin varisleri, Muhammed'in (s.a.v.) soyundan gelen, büyük, sabırlı ve metanetli mücahit halkıyla büyük gurur duymaktan övünüyoruz.\n\nEy Kassam Tugayları, ey en şerefli insanlar, ey en büyük insanlar, ey Allah'ın seçilmiş kulları arasından seçilmiş olanlar, ey sabreden ve değişmeyen dürüstler, çektiğiniz acılar için size selam olsun ve yuvanın sonu ne kadar güzeldir!\n\nGazze'ye, topraklarına, sularına, gökyüzüne ve havasına barış olsun. Erkeklerine, kadınlarına ve çocuklarına barış olsun. Direniş savaşçılarına ve kahramanlarına barış olsun. Çektiğiniz tüm kayıp, esaret, yara ve yerinden edilme acıları için size barış olsun.\n\nBugün çektiğiniz zorluklara ve kış soğuğuna katlanırken, size selam olsun Kassam Tugayları. Yıpranmış çadırlarınıza, çatlamış evlerinize ve yorgun bedenlerinize selam olsun. Ama ruhunuz, imanınız, azminiz ve Allaha olan kesin inancınız, acılarınızdan zevk alan ve düşüşünüzü bekleyen tüm düşmanların ve komplocuların hayal edebileceğinden daha güçlüdür. Ve Allah'ın izniyle, buna izin vermeyeceğim. Sizler, şanlı bir tarihin şanı ve başlangıcısınız.\n\nKassam Tugayları: Mücahitlerin kanının ailelerinin kanıyla karışması ve liderlerinin ve ailelerinin, sahip oldukları her şeyi feda edenlerin saflarında yer alması ne büyük bir şeref ve ayrıcalıktır! Biz sizdeniz, siz de bizdensiniz. Hep birlikte, gönüllü kalplerle, Rabbimizin çağrısına karşılık olarak ve O'nun sunacaklarına dair umutla, sahip olduğumuz en kıymetli şeyi sunduk.\n\nEbu Ubeyde: Biz eminiz ki Allah amellerimizi boşa çıkarmayacak ve bu temiz kan O'nun katında kaybolmayacaktır. Rabbinize güvenin; zalimlerin sonu mutlaka gelecektir, zaman alsa bile. Allah'ın zalimlerin yaptıklarından habersiz olduğunu sanmayın.\n\nEy Ebu Ubeyda, Gazze'de, Kudüs'te, Batı Şeria'da, işgal altındaki iç bölgelerde ve diasporada bulunan halkımızın evlatları, ey büyük ve geniş milletimizin evlatları, ey dünyanın tüm özgür insanları, bugün size büyük bir gurur ve şerefle, işgalin ateşkesi ihlal edip geçen Mart ayında suç dolu savaşına yeniden başlamasının ardından şehit düşen, uzun bir dürüst şehitler kervanına katılan büyük bir halkımızın ve kahraman mücahitler topluluğunu ilan ediyoruz.\n\nEbu Ubaida, burada, cihatçı görevlerini yorulmadan ve bıkmadan yerine getirirken savaş alanında ve komuta merkezlerinde şehit düşen cesur Kassam liderlerinden bir grubu anmak isteriz.\n\nEbu Ubaida, İzzeddin el-Kassam Tugayları Kurmay Başkanı, en iyi selefinin en iyi halefi, Kassam Tugaylarını çok zor bir dönemde yöneten, milletin büyük şehidi Ebu Halid el-Deif'in ardından El-Aksa selinde operasyon biriminin komutanı olan, parlak zekâlı büyük önder, şehit mücahit Muhammed Sinwar Ebu İbrahim'in vefatından dolayı derin üzüntü duymaktadır.\n\nEbu Ubaida, şehit Muhammed Sinwar'ın, şanlı 7 Ekim operasyonunun planlanmasında ve yürütülmesinde, savunma planının çeşitli ayrıntılarının denetlenmesinde ve Gazze'ye yönelik acımasız işgal saldırısına karşı koymada büyük katkı ve önemli bir rol oynadığını söyledi. Bu, büyük liderimizin onlarca yıl önce başlattığı, kutsal intikamdan yıkılan hayallere, Han Yunus Tugayı'na liderlik etmekten Kassam Tugayları'ndaki bir dizi üst düzey liderlik pozisyonuna kadar büyük dönüm noktalarıyla noktalanan ve onur ve haysiyet cephelerinde şehit düşmesiyle doruğa ulaşan bir yolculuktu.\n\nEbu Ubaida'nın yanı sıra, Kassam Tugayları'ndaki Rafah Tugayı komutanı olan ve lider Ebu İbrahim Sinwar ve diğer liderler ve mücahitlerle birlikte şehit düşen büyük lider Muhammed Şabana Ebu Anas da vardı. Ebu Anas, iki büyük lider Ebu Şamala ve El-Attar'ın da arkadaşıydı.\n\nŞehit komutan Muhammed Şabana'nın oğlu Ebu Ubeyde, medyadan tedarike kadar çeşitli görevlerde katkıda bulunmuştur. Güneyde nitelikli operasyonlarıyla tanınan bir kahramandı; kaybolan hayalden patlama uyarısına, Hadar Goldin'in yakalanmasına ve Rafah'ın kahraman mücahitlerinin Mescid-i Aksa seli sırasında yazdığı büyük yaratıcılığa kadar birçok başarıya imza atmıştır.\n\nEbu Ubaida ayrıca size, büyük önder Hakem el-İssa Ebu Ömer el-Muhacir'in vefatını da duyurur; o, kendini adamış bir mücahit, mütevazı, Allah'tan korkan bir önderdi; kardeşleri arasında yaşayan, çatışma alanlarında metanetli ve cesur, Filistin'de cihat emanetini taşıyarak ülkeyi dolaşan bir şahsiyetti.\n\n#gazze #hamas #batışeria #kudüs #yahyasinvar #kassamtugayları #soykırım #aksatufanı #kudüstugayları #islamicihad #direniş #sansür #ateşkes #ebuubeyde #filistin #işgal #hamaslideri #yardım #refahsınırı #refah #islamicihad #Türkiye #garantör #sözcü #sözcüsü #şehit \nHudhaifa al-Kahlout Abu Ibrahim\nحذيفة الكحلوت (أبا عبيدة)",

    "description": "Yüzünü kimse görmedi. Gizliliği İsrail’i oldukça sinirlendiriyor. Bu bahsettiğim kişiyle ilgili bilgi çok sınırlı. Merak edenler için hemen söyleyeyim. Profil’in bu bölümünde size Hamas’ın Sözcüsü Ebu Ubeyde’yi anlatacağım. İsrail’in Gazze’deki sivil, savunmasız halkı bombalaması masumların ve özellikle kadınların, çocukların hayatını kaybetmesinin üzerinden bir ay geçti. Bunun ne kadar süreceği belli değil. Saldırılar siz bu videoyu izlerken de maalesef hala devam ediyor. Bunun önüne geçmek ve orada yaşananlara son vermek için herkes elinden geleni yapıyor. Gazze halkının direnişine ortak olan, son yayınladığı videoyla da özgürlüklerini alana kadar savaşmaya devam edeceklerini söyleyen Kassam Tugayları'nın resmi medya sözcüsü olarak bilinen Ebu Hamza’nın hikayesi de oldukça gizemli. Kimisi onu Ebu Ubeyde olarak da tanıyor. Hamas'ın psikolojik ve medya savaşının ana arteri olarak görülmesi nedeniyle İsrail'in suikast listelerinde en çok aranan kişilerden biri. Halife Ömer bin Hattab döneminde Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabe Ebu Ubeyde bin Cerrah'dan dolayı kendisine Ebu Ubeyde lakabı verilmiş. Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı ve görünüşü bilinmiyor bununla birlikte, kendisi ve hayatıyla ilgili detaylar veya kişisel bilgiler yok olmasa bile neredeyse yok denecek kadar az.Medya kuruluşlarında veya yayınladığı görsel açıklamalarda yüzünü göstermiyor. Yüzünü açacak mı? O keyfiyenin altındaki kişi gerçekte kim? Bu da oldukça merak edilen sorulardan biri. Ebu Ubeyde’nin bilinen ve bilinmeyen tüm hikayesini GZT editörü Kübra Akçelik anlattı.\n\nVideoyu beğenin!

Past incidents have shown that 'Israel' often spreads false reports about targeted leaders to manipulate their behavior, gather intelligence, and prepare for potential operations.\n\nThe resistance warned that such misinformation is part of a broader psychological warfare effort intended to destabilize internal morale and create confusion within Gaza.\n\nCitizens were urged not to circulate these claims, emphasizing that these rumors are aimed at weakening public confidence and undermining the unity of the Palestinian front.\n🔴 Stay updated with the latest global news:\n🌐 Website: https://en.royanews.tv/\n📲 Follow us for real-time news:\n👉 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n👉 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/royanewsenglish\n👉 Twitter: https://twitter.com/RoyaNewsEnglish\n\nIf you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on our YouTube channel without your authorization you may submit a copyright infringement notification at Youtube@roya.tv.\nPlease be sure to consider whether fair use fair dealing or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit.\n\n#shortfeed #breakingnews #explore #viralvideo #foryou #shorts #trending #shortsvideo",

    "description": "Ebu Ubeyde'nin sembolik kefiyesinin asıl sahibi. Henüz 19 yaşındayken İsrail'in kırmızı bültenle arananlar listesine girdi. Kırmızı bültenle aranmasına rağmen dönemin İsrail Başbakanı'nın \"efsane\" diye nitelendirdiği ve 3 yıl yurt dışında yaşarsa hakkındaki tüm suçlamaları düşüreceğini vaad ettiği kişi. Hamas’ın silahlı kanadı İzzettin Kassam Tugayları’nın ilk üyelerinden birisi. Profil'de bu haftaki konuğumuz, hayatı bir filme konu olan İmad Akil. Tam adı İmad Hasan İbrahim Akil. Siz onu Ebu Hüseyin olarak da biliyor olabilirsiniz. 1971'de Gazze Şeridi'nin kuzeyindeki Cebeliye Mülteci Kampında doğdu. İmad Akil 22 yaşına kadar İsrail verilerine göre 40'a yakın operasyon gerçekleştirdi. İmad, kendini gizleme konusundaki üstün bir yeteneğe sahipti. Sadece gözlerini gösterecek şekilde tüm yüzünü örttüğü kırmızı kefiyesi hala Filistin direnişinin sembolü. Her operasyon sonrası bir video çekerek operasyon detaylarını anlatmasına rağmen yıllarca kimliği bulunamadı. Yaşını bile kimse bilmiyordu. Her operasyonun görüntüleri elinde mevcuttu. Bu fotoğrafları çekmekle kalmıyor yayınlıyordu da. Tek öne çıkan özelliği tabii ki iyi saklanması değildi. Sıfır mesafe operasyonları onun icadıydı. Ve bir önemli nokta daha var ki bu operasyonların asıl amacı öldürmek değil, İsrail ordusunun yıkılmaz görüntüsünü yok etmekti. Bunu başardı da. Askeri yetkililerinin psikolojik yapısının dağıtılmasını, imajlarına zarar vermeyi önemsiyordu. Bu yöntemle hem İsrail'i sarsmayı, hem de Filistin halkına cesaret vermeyi amaçlıyordu. GZT'de bu hafta İmad Akil'in Profilini Sena Özyurt anlattı.\n\n00:00 Giriş\n00:50 İmad Akil kimdir?\n03:18 İmad Akil'in askeri mücadelesi nasıl başladı?\n06:04 İsrail başbakanının Akil ile yaptığı anlaşma neydi? \n06:53 Oslo anlaşmasından sonra ne oldu? \n09:53 İmad Akil'i diğerlerinden ayıran özellikleri nelerdi? \n09:56 İmad Akil nasıl vefat etti?\n\nVideoyu beğenin!

    "description": "Ebu Ubeyde, İsrail’in korkulu rüyası… Ebu Ubeyde’nin yüzünü bugüne kadar hiç kimse görmedi. Geçmişini ise yıllarca bir sır gibi sakladı. İsrail’in Filistin’e saldırmasının ardından en çok merak edilen isimlerden biri Ebu Ubeyde oldu. Hatta adına şarkılar bile yazıldı. Biz onu, yüzünü tamamen kaplayan kefiye ile görmeye alıştık. Yüzünü örten bu kefiyenin ardında nasıl biri olduğunu kimse bilmiyor. \nEbu Ubeyde, İzzeddin el-Kassam komutanı Muhammed el-Deif'in 7 Ekim Cumartesi günü İsrail'in güneyinde 1200 kişinin ölümüne yol açan, Hamas'ın verdiği isimle El Aksa Tufanı Operasyonunun başladığını duyurmasının ardından tanınmış bir isim haline geldi. Bu tarihten itibaren de başta Filistin olmak üzere tüm dünyanın dilinden düşmüyor. Ama onun ortaya çıkışı yeni değil… \n2002 yılında Kassam Tugayları’nın saha yetkilisi olarak görev aldı. Bu, Ebu Ubeyde’nin bilinen ilk göreviydi. Ardından 2005’te İsrail Gazze’den çekildikten sonra, Hamas hareketinin silahlı kanadı olan İzzeddin el-Kassam Tugayları’nın sözcülüğüne atandı. Ama onun dünya kamuoyu tarafından fark edilmesi bir yıl sonra mümkün oldu. 2006’da İsrailli asker Gilad Şalit’in yakalandığını duyuran kişi, Ebu Ebeyde’ydi… Bu açıklamada ilk defa sesi duyuldu. 2014’te de İsrail askeri Şaul Aron’un çatışma esnasında kaçırıldığını duyuran kişi ondan başkası değildi.Bu iki açıklamayla ön plana çıkan Ebu Ubeyde yıllar sonra dünyanın konuştuğu bir isim haline gelecekti. \nPortre’nin yeni bölümünde “Ebu Ubeyde kimdir?” sorusuna cevap aradık.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAkşam TV Youtube Kanalına Abone Olmak İçin:\nhttps://buff.ly/2uSW61F\n\nAkşam TV Sosyal Medya Hesapları:\nTwitter:       https://twitter.com/aksamwebtv\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/aksamtv/\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/aksamtv/",

The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The masked spokesman’s latest video, of unclear recording date, reignited speculation. Just days earlier, Obeida warned Israel of bloodshed and hostage risks if Gaza City’s offensive continued.

    "description": "Neden Ebu Ubeyde kırmızı kefiye kullanıyor? Bunun sebebi geçmişte; İmad Akil'de yatıyor. Peki kimdi İmad? Kırmızı kefiyesiyle ön plana çıkan İmad Akil, Hamas'ın çocuk yaştaki kurucularından biriydi. Harekete katıldığında daha 17 yaşında eczacılık öğrencisiydi. Okulu bırakıp gençleri İsrail'in işgaline karşı bilinçlendirmeyi görev bilmişti. Ancak çok geçmeden İmad, arananlar listesine alındı.\nİsrail'in onu kırmızı bültenle aradığı günlerde henüz 19 yaşındaydı. 'Şehit oluncaya dek Filistin'de kalacağım' diyen İmad, İsrail askerleri tarafından 22 yaşında Gazze'de silah taliminden dönerken şehit edildi; tam 70 kurşun ile. Ebu Ubeyde de bu davayı temsilen o günden beri kırmızı kefiyesini çıkarmıyor.\n\nVideoyu beğenin!

    "description": "Hamas’ military wing spokesperson, Abu Obeida, has re-emerged after four months of silence with a fiery televised address. Speaking for the first time since Israel renewed its military offensive in Gaza in March, Obeida condemned the Arab world's silence over the suffering in Gaza and accused them of betraying the Palestinian cause. His harsh words targeted not just Israel, but the Arab regimes he labelled as complicit.\r\n\r\nObeida also outlined Hamas' evolving battle strategy, revealing counter-operations to Israel’s “Gideon’s Chariots.” The speech, filled with warnings and a tone of defiance, has stunned many, especially coming amid rising tensions between Israel and Syria. His appearance comes as a symbolic message — Hamas is neither broken nor backing down. Watch the full speech to understand what’s next in this escalating conflict.\r\n\r\n#Hamas #AbuObaida #IsraelGazaWar #GazaUnderAttack #ArabWorld #MiddleEastConflict #IDF #Palestine #GideonsChariots #IsraelSyria #WarSpeech #ArabSilence #GazaNews #AbuObaidaSpeech #BreakingNews #HamasVsIDF #IsraelUpdates #HamasCounterstrike #PalestinianResistance #ArabBetrayal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

    "description": "Abu Obeida, spokesperson of Hamas’ Al Qassam Brigades, appeared in a new video Monday, defying Israeli claims of his assassination. The IDF earlier said it conducted a targeted strike in Gaza’s al-Rimal neighborhood on August 30, reportedly killing Obeida, his wife, and children. Saudi network Al Arabiya cited sources confirming his death, while Israeli media echoed optimism he was eliminated. Hamas and Palestinian outlets neither denied nor confirmed the reports. The masked spokesman’s latest video, of unclear recording date, reignited speculation. Just days earlier, Obeida warned Israel of bloodshed and hostage risks if Gaza City’s offensive continued.

    "description": "Abu Ubaida News : इज़राइल ने हमास के खिलाफ अपने युद्ध में एक बड़ी सफलता का दावा करते हुए घोषणा की है कि आईडीएफ बलों ने संभवतः समूह के लंबे समय से नकाबपोश प्रवक्ता अबू ओबैदा को मार गिराया है। सिनवार के बाद हमास के सबसे प्रतीकात्मक व्यक्ति माने जाने वाले ओबैदा की मौत संगठन के लिए सबसे बड़े झटकों में से एक होगी। यह हमला इस हफ्ते की शुरुआत में इज़राइल द्वारा यमन के हूती प्रधानमंत्री की हत्या के बाद हुआ है, जो पूरे क्षेत्र में एक तीव्र अभियान का संकेत देता है। हालाँकि गाजा में इस हमले में 11 लोगों के हताहत होने की खबर है, लेकिन इज़राइली अधिकारी सतर्क रूप से आशावादी बने हुए हैं और इसे हमास के खिलाफ लड़ाई में एक महत्वपूर्ण मोड़ बता रहे हैं।\r\n\r\nIsrael claims a major breakthrough in its war against Hamas, announcing that IDF forces likely killed Abu Obeida, the long-time masked spokesman of the group. Considered Hamas’ most symbolic figure after Sinwar, Obeida’s death would mark one of the heaviest blows to the organization. The strike follows Israel’s killing of Yemen’s Houthi PM earlier this week, signaling an intensified campaign across the region. While Gaza reports 11 casualties in the raid, Israeli officials remain cautiously optimistic, calling this a turning point in the fight against Hamas.\r\n\r\n#IDF #Hamas #AbuObeida #Israel #GazaWar #MiddleEastConflict #TelAviv #BreakingNews #WarUpdates #IsraelDefenseForces #Gaza #HamasLeader #Sinwar #Houthis #IsraelVsHamas #MaskedSpokesman #AbuObeidaKilled #Terrorism #MiddleEastNews #WarOnTerror #IDFStrikes #ConflictZone #GlobalSecurity #IsraelNews #WarFooting #MilitaryStrike #TerrorLeader #WorldNews #SecurityCrisis #GazaConflict\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n                                                                                                                            https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nSubscribe to OneIndia Hindi Channel for the latest updates on Politics, Sports, Entertainment and related videos...\n\nOneindia Hindi: / @oneindiahindi\n\nOneindia Sports: / @oneindiasports\n\nFollow us on Twitter : https://x.com/oneindiaHindi\n\nLike us on Facebook : / oneindiahindi\n\nFollow us on Instagram : / oneindiahindi\n\n\n~HT.410~PR.338~GR.124~",

Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism, and one described outcomes as “looking good,” while multiple sources identified him as the likely target.

Hamas threatens to halt partial deals if indirect talks fail and reiterates its hostage exchange offer for a full ceasefire.

    "description": "The Israeli Defense Forces claim to have killed Abu Obeida, the masked spokesman of Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, in a Gaza strike on August 30th. Long considered the “hidden face” of Hamas, Obeida has been a symbol of resistance since 2006, when he rose to prominence after the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. His identity was never revealed publicly until IDF released an estimated image. Palestinians viewed him as a hero, while Israel marked him as a top target. His death, if confirmed, marks a major blow to Hamas. \r\n\r\n#AbuObeida #Hamas #IDF #GazaWar #MiddleEast #BreakingNews #TelAviv #Israel #Palestine #WarUpdate #MaskedHero #Resistance #AlQassam #MilitaryStrike #TopTarget #TerrorGroup #IsraelHamasConflict #Gaza #Sinwar #Houthis #MiddleEastWar #HamasSpokesman #PsyOps #WarNews #IsraelDefenceForces #Airstrike #ConflictNews #GlobalSecurity #BreakingStory #WarInMiddleEast\n\nAlso Read\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid Domestic and International Criticism :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825995.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid Domestic and International Concerns :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825985.html?ref=YTDesc\n\nNetanyahu Defends Expanded Military Offensive in Gaza Amid International Criticism :: https://www.oneindia.com/international/netanyahu-defends-new-military-offensive-in-gaza-011-7825981.html?ref=YTDesc\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNews that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN\n\nOneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular,  informative, and entertaining.

    "description": "Yüzünü kimse görmedi. Gizliliği İsrail’i oldukça sinirlendiriyor. Bu bahsettiğim kişiyle ilgili bilgi çok sınırlı. Merak edenler için hemen söyleyeyim. Profil’in bu bölümünde size Hamas’ın Sözcüsü Ebu Ubeyde’yi anlatacağım. İsrail’in Gazze’deki sivil, savunmasız halkı bombalaması masumların ve özellikle kadınların, çocukların hayatını kaybetmesinin üzerinden bir ay geçti. Bunun ne kadar süreceği belli değil. Saldırılar siz bu videoyu izlerken de maalesef hala devam ediyor. Bunun önüne geçmek ve orada yaşananlara son vermek için herkes elinden geleni yapıyor. Gazze halkının direnişine ortak olan, son yayınladığı videoyla da özgürlüklerini alana kadar savaşmaya devam edeceklerini söyleyen Kassam Tugayları'nın resmi medya sözcüsü olarak bilinen Ebu Hamza’nın hikayesi de oldukça gizemli. Kimisi onu Ebu Ubeyde olarak da tanıyor. Hamas'ın psikolojik ve medya savaşının ana arteri olarak görülmesi nedeniyle İsrail'in suikast listelerinde en çok aranan kişilerden biri. Halife Ömer bin Hattab döneminde Kudüs'ü fetheden sahabe Ebu Ubeyde bin Cerrah'dan dolayı kendisine Ebu Ubeyde lakabı verilmiş. Ebu Ubeyde'nin gerçek adı ve görünüşü bilinmiyor bununla birlikte, kendisi ve hayatıyla ilgili detaylar veya kişisel bilgiler yok olmasa bile neredeyse yok denecek kadar az.Medya kuruluşlarında veya yayınladığı görsel açıklamalarda yüzünü göstermiyor. Yüzünü açacak mı? O keyfiyenin altındaki kişi gerçekte kim? Bu da oldukça merak edilen sorulardan biri.

Tentaranya menjadi bahan cemoohan bagi anak bungsu Palestina,\" katanya, dikutip dari Al Jazeera.\n\n“Apa yang akan dilakukan oleh teknologi rudal, tank yang dibentengi, dan pesawat modern dengan senjata mematikannya di hadapan kekuatan keimanan seorang Mujahid yang menghabiskan dua bulan atau lebih di kompleks pertahanannya, menunggu kekuatan yang maju, menunggu untuk mengalahkan musuhnya dan menjalankan misinya, mengabdikan semua itu kepada Tuhan dan percaya pada keadilan tujuannya?” lanjutnya.\n\nKemudian, salam pidato itu, Abu Obaida juga menyinggung narasi yang digunakan oleh zionis sebelum mendirikan negara Israel di Palestina.\n\n\"Sapi merah dibawa sebagai implementasi dari mitos agama menjijikkan yang dirancang untuk menyerang perasaan seluruh bangsa di jantung Arabisme dan jalan nabinya dan kenaikannya ke surga,\" katanya.\n\nIa juga mengatakan perang di Jalur Gaza ini adalah seruan kepada setiap muslim untuk menyadari sifat konflik ini.\n\nYang mana, ia menyebut, latar belakang dan sifat pemerintahan zionis merupakan keturunan geng teroris Haganah.\n\nLebih lanjut, Abu Obaida juga mengatakan faksi perlawanan Palestina tidak mempunyai pilihan selain menggunakan kekuatan untuk mengingatkan dunia bahwa Palestina memiliki rakyat dan pejuang.\n\nDiketahui, setelah Operasi Banjir Al-Aqsa pada Sabtu (7/10/2023), Israel melancarkan serangan besar-besaran ke Jalur Gaza hingga hari ini.\n\nIsrael memperkirakan masih ada sekitar 137 sandera yang ditahan Hamas di Jalur Gaza.\n\nJumlah kematian warga Palestina di Jalur Gaza terhitung 23.968 hingga Senin (15/1/2024), sementara 1.200 kematian di wilayah Israel, yang direvisi oleh Israel menjadi 1.147 jiwa.\n\n(Tribun-Video.com/Tribunnews.com)\n\nArtikel ini telah tayang di Tribunnews.com dengan judul Perang Hari ke-100, Abu Ubaida: Lemahnya Tentara Israel, Nangis Ketakutan Hadapi Hamas, https://www.tribunnews.com/internasional/2024/01/15/perang-hari-ke-100-abu-ubaida-lemahnya-tentara-israel-nangis-ketakutan-hadapi-hamas?page=all.\nPenulis: Yunita Rahmayanti\nEditor: Garudea Prabawati\n\nHost: Nina Agustina\nVP: Ika Vidya\n\n\n#abuobaida #abuubaidah #hamas #idf #palestine #palestina #israel #gaza #hamasvsisrael #israelpalestineconflict",
